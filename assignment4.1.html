<div>In HTML, span and div elements are used to define parts of a document so that they are identifiable when a unique classification is necessary. While other HTML elements such as p (paragraph), em (emphasis) and so on accurately represent the semantics of the content, the use of span and div leads to better accessibility for readers and easier maintainability for authors. Where no existing HTML element is applicable, span and div can represent parts of a document so that HTML attributes such as class, id, lang, or dir can be applied.[1][2]

span represents an inline portion of a document, for example words within a sentence. div represents a block-level portion of a document such as a few paragraphs, or an image with its caption. Neither element has any meaning in itself but they allow semantic attributes (e.g. lang="en-US"), CSS styling (e.g., color and typography), or client-side scripting (e.g., animation, hiding, and augmentation) to be applied.</div>
